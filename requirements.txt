# This package was split of from ruamel.yaml, so that ruamel.yaml can be build as a universal wheel. Apart from the C code seldom changing, and taking a long time to compile for all platforms, this allows installation of the .so on Linux systems under /usr/lib64/pythonX.Y (without a .pth file or a ruamel directory) and the Python code for ruamel.yaml under /usr/lib/pythonX.Y.
